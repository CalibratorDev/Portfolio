## About me

I'm a positive young man who enjoys all things entertainment and effort. When some thing needs to get done, I will make sure to find a very optimized and efficient way to do so, but just as well keep the quality of my work as high as possible.

From a young age, I've shown better learning capabilities than other kids my age, and I've found many ways to help me learn faster than the average person, even going as far as to graduate early from highschool, and start / finish tertiary schooling, all the while kids my age are not even half-way done with their senior year.

I hope to expand my knowledge of things technical in nature, and to help progress any business, projects, or goals either I or anyone else has, as I enjoy assisting others to achieve what they wish to. I mainly wish to learn coding languages so i can start working on my own goals and personal projects, to further my own personal education and expertise.
